- # Opening:
    - When you think about your ideal state of process, what metaphors come to mind? What do you see?
- # Foundational principles:
    - Assumed context: sustained open-ended problem solving (like research, capstone projects)
        - Have to formulate problems, adjust (not necessarily a clear path all the time)
    - Goal state is achieving flow: like surfing: https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_flow_the_secret_to_happiness?language=en 
        - Contra being a "productivity machine"
    - Tinkering, not overhauling
    - Investing, long-term thinking
        - Compound interest, over the long term
- # Practicalities, by zones of "productivity":
    - **Vision**: How do you know what you should do?
        - Issue: plans and situated action
        - GTD for academics https://rtalbert.org/gtd/
            - Pillars: 
                - getting stuff out of your head, capturing things quickly as they come up so you don't clog your head
                - regular reviews at Multiple levels: city-level, street-level, and moment-level
            - Similar: Lists in a Google Doc - print off every once in awhile + review every few days - need to print out every once in awhile, to think spatially about it
            - Keep it simple - make it match the structure of the task you care about
            - Context-specific lists
        - Delay in saying yes
            - Related: No committee
        - Separate by life goals and daily activities
        - Plan by reachability
            - Time how long things have taken
            - Associate time with value
                - Toggl
                - RescueTime
        - Other stuff
            - Bullet Journaling
            - https://complice.co/
            - Mindfulness / meditation
    - **Habit / Rhythm**: How do you make your system robust to ebbs and flows in energy / time / motivation?
        - The principle of least resistance: - http://matt.might.net/articles/least-resistance-weight-loss/
            - Similar: general principle of habit formation and behavior change - incentives and environments > individual willpower

                - why efforts to reform science practice have failed: https://corelab.blog/2020/03/05/science-for-science-reformers/
        - Methods of blocking stuff so you don't have to decide
            - screen time on phones
            - cold turkey
            - self control (the app, not your willpower!)
            - FocusBooster
        - Accountability
            - With friends
            - Or external, like with beeminder: pay up if you don't meet your goals
            - Forest - when you want to stay focused you stay away from your phone and the tree grows - over a long term the forest grows
        - Rituals
    - **Energy**: How do you ensure that you have energy that is matched to the tasks you need accomplish?
        - Sleep
        - Find when you are most "productive"
        - Eat well
        - Exercise
        - Therapy / counseling
            - More generally self-care
